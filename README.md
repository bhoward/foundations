Foundations of Computation
=======

This will eventually be the introduction to a book about the mathematical foundations of computer science, appropriate for an intermediate undergraduate level. It is being written for DePauw University's CSC 233, Foundations of Computation (hence the name...).

Here is some gratuitous $$\TeX$$, just for testing:
$$e^{i\pi}+1 = 0$$
